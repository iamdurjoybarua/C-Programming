# Fundamental C Programs

This repository contains a collection of basic C programming examples that demonstrate core programming concepts and provide solutions to common introductory problems. It's a great resource for beginners learning C or anyone looking for quick implementations of these fundamental algorithms.

## Programs Included

This repository includes the following C programs:

* **Matrix Multiplication:** Performs the multiplication of two matrices.
* **Grade Calculator:** Calculates a letter grade based on a given score or marks.
* **Day of the Week:** Determines the day of the week for a given date.
* **Area of a Circle:** Calculates the area of a circle given its radius.
* **Temperature Conversion Program:** Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
* **Fibonacci Sequence Generator with Limit:** Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit.
* **Factorial of a Number:** Computes the factorial of a given integer.
* **Leap Year Checker:** Determines if a given year is a leap year.
* **Prime Number Checker:** Checks if a given number is a prime number.
* **Vowel or Consonant Checker:** Identifies whether a given character is a vowel or a consonant.
* **Character Type Identifier:** Determines the type of a given character (e.g., uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit, special character).

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository)

2.  **Navigate to the repository directory:**
    ```bash
    cd fundamental-c-programs
    ```
    (Or whatever you named your repository)

3.  **Compilation:**
    You can compile each program individually using a C compiler (like GCC). For example, to compile `matrix_multiplication.c`:
    ```bash
    gcc matrix_multiplication.c -o matrix_multiplication
    ```

4.  **Execution:**
    After successful compilation, you can run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./matrix_multiplication
    ```

    Follow the prompts in each program to provide input and see the output.
